# Tkinter Beginner Projects Showcase

## Introduction
This repository serves as a showcase of projects developed using the book, "Python GUI Programing with Tkinter, 2nd edition".

# Projects:
## Project 1: Banana Quiz
    - Description: This project served as an introduction to the Tkinter module. 
    The idea was to introduce how the module is formatted and how the program
    interacts with user input.

## Project 2: ABQ Data Entry Program
    - Description: This project introduces the steps towards understanding a 
    problem and designing a solution. This includes interviewing users, reST files,
    examining the data requirements, creating a form layout, and introducing Ttk
    - Problems: This code is very repetative. The book is designed for
    people with basic knowledge of programming. The authors should have created 
    functions. I believe the target audience is already familiar with functions
    and also objects. However by writing the repetative code I started to get a
    better grasp of what each line was doing. Maybe that was the intended result.
